	<!--This is the head of the website.-->
	<!-- Think of the <head> element as the brain of the page; you set the page title here, and link external stylesheets and JavaScript files for the extra style and pizzaz! It can be positioned or placed anywhere in your page, but I prefer my brain to be at the top! ;)-->
